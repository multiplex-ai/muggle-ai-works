# Test Case Chain Readiness

A test case may depend on prerequisite ("parent") test cases in the project's **test-plan graph** — e.g. "edit item" depends on "create item". Before generating or replaying the chosen test case, every ancestor in that chain must already have a ready script, or the run starts from missing state and fails for the wrong reason.

This is the **graph the backend owns** — do not infer the chain from titles or `precondition` text. Read it from `muggle-remote-test-case-ancestors-get`.

**Ready** = `muggle-remote-test-script-list` (with the ancestor's `testCaseId`) returns at least one replayable/succeeded script — the same bar Step 5 uses to offer replay.

## Procedure

Run once the target `testCaseId` is chosen and the local URL + services are confirmed (the generation calls below need `localUrl` and `cwd`).

1. **Resolve the chain.** `muggle-remote-test-case-ancestors-get` with the target `testCaseId`. Response: `{ testCaseId, ancestors, orphan }`.
   - `orphan: true` **or** empty `ancestors` → no prerequisites. Skip the rest; continue to Step 5.
   - Otherwise `ancestors` is ordered **immediate-parent → root**. Reverse it to **root-first** so prerequisites are satisfied bottom-up.

2. **For each ancestor, root-first:**
   - Check readiness via `muggle-remote-test-script-list` (`projectId`, `testCaseId` = ancestor). Ready → skip to the next ancestor.
   - Not ready → **generate its script only (never replay):**
     1. `muggle-remote-test-case-get` for the ancestor.
     2. Determine `freshSession` for that ancestor from its own content — same rules as Step 6.
     3. `muggle-local-execute-test-generation` with the ancestor test case, `localUrl`, `cwd`, and a long `timeoutMs` (see Step 6's timeout guidance). Do **not** call `muggle-local-execute-replay`.
     4. `muggle-local-publish-test-script` (`runId`, `cloudTestCaseId` = ancestor) so the generated script is promoted as that ancestor's canonical replay script — it now reads as ready for any case downstream.

3. **All ancestors ready** → continue to Step 5 for the target test case.

## When an ancestor's generation fails

If an ancestor's generation does not reach `passed` (read it via `muggle-local-run-result-get`, never the execute stdout tail), the target's prerequisite state is missing. **Halt the chain** and surface which ancestor failed and why, then ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Stop** — don't run the target; the chain is broken.
- **Proceed anyway** — run the target without the prerequisite (likely to fail; only if the user judges the state already exists).
- **Give feedback** — invoke the `muggle-feedback` skill with the failed ancestor's `runId`.

Do not silently skip a failed ancestor and run the target.

## Notes

- The target test case is **not** in its own `ancestors` list — only its prerequisites are.
- Each ancestor is a single path to the root (one parent per node), so the reversed list has no duplicates; generate each at most once per session.
- This walks the **full** chain to root, not just the immediate parent — a grandparent without a ready script is generated before its child.
