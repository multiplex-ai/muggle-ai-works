# Watcher Per-Tick Contract

The procedure for the **tick mode** of `muggle-pr-followup` — one polling iteration scoped to one PR. The watcher is a dumb pipe: it polls for actionable review threads, CI checks, and the branch's standing against its base, dispatches `/muggle-do` if there's unaddressed review feedback, fixable red CI, or a branch that's behind or conflicting with its base, and exits. It does not classify, fix, resolve, rebase, amend requirements, post replies, run cycles, or escalate.

Routing into this mode is documented in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md#routing). The architectural rationale lives in the brain docs `architecture/2026-05-08-muggle-do-pr-comment-loop-design.md` (the overall loop) and `architecture/2026-06-06-pr-followup-thread-state-baseline-design.md` (the thread-state dispatch trigger).

## Turn preamble

```
**muggle-pr-followup tick** — polling <repo>#<pr-number>.
```

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS = <slug> <pr-number>` (or `<pr-number>` alone — slug inferred from on-disk state per [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md#routing)).

## Inputs from disk

Read these from `~/.muggle-ai/muggle-do/sessions/<slug>/`:

- `prs.json` — see [`state-schemas.md`](state-schemas.md#prsjson). The watcher touches the single entry whose `number` matches the dispatched PR number.
- `last_seen.json` — see [`state-schemas.md`](state-schemas.md#last_seenjson). Keyed by `"<owner>/<repo>#<n>"`.

If either file is missing or the PR is not in `prs.json`, the tick is a no-op. Log an error line in `followup.log` and exit. The watcher must not be invoked in this state — if it happens, the slot is corrupt.

## Writing state

Every `increment`/`reset` this procedure applies to `last_seen.json`, and the `prs.json` refresh in Step 1, is a **whole-file rewrite** (Read → change field → Write) per [`../_shared/session-state-writes.md`](../_shared/session-state-writes.md). **Never** patch session JSON with the Edit tool — an exact-string match against these files silently fails ("malformed edit") and drops the update, so the counter never advances.

## Procedure

### Step 0 — Stale-fire guard, then record this cron's id

If `prs.json[0].state` on disk is already `merged` or `closed`, this slot was finalized by a prior tick and this is a stale (queued) fire — per-minute cron fires enqueued while the session was busy still drain after the cron is cancelled. Defensively cancel any lingering cron for this slug per [`cancel-cron.md`](cancel-cron.md) (no-op if none), append a `stale-tick` line to `followup.log`, and exit. Do not re-fetch or re-finalize.

Otherwise, self-record this watcher's cron id per [`record-cron-id.md`](record-cron-id.md) before proceeding. Recording every tick — while `CronList` can still see the cron — is what keeps the id a valid `CronDelete` target after a session continue / compaction blinds `CronList` to it, so teardown ([`finalize.md`](finalize.md), [`reconcile.md`](reconcile.md)) can always kill the orphan.

### Step 1 — Refresh PR state

Per [`../_shared/vcs/github/pr-metadata.md`](../_shared/vcs/github/pr-metadata.md). Update `prs.json[0].head_sha` and `prs.json[0].state` from the response; keep `mergeable` (conflict signal) for Step 5, and run the recipe's `compare` call to capture `behind_by` (out-of-date signal) for Step 5.

### Step 2 — Termination check

If `state` is `MERGED` or `CLOSED`:

1. Finalize the slot per [`finalize.md`](finalize.md) — mark terminal, write `result.md`, log + telemetry, unschedule this watcher's cron.
2. Hand off the terminal wrap-up as the last action of the turn — for both `MERGED` and `CLOSED`:

   ```
   /muggle-do post-merge cleanup slug=<slug> state=<merged|closed>
   ```

   `/muggle-do` owns the worktree/branch knowledge: it runs teardown only on `merged` (honoring the `autoCleanup` gate — `closed` is unmerged, so the branch and any worktree stay intact), then suggests the next step. This is a runtime dispatch, not a doc dependency on `/muggle-do` — see the one-way rule in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
3. Exit. The watcher has unscheduled itself; no future ticks fire for this PR.


### Step 2.5 — Blocked-tick gate (remind, or resume on change)

Only when `last_seen.blocked` is present (the watcher is awaiting the owner on a durable human-block — see Step 7 and [`state-schemas.md`](state-schemas.md#last_seenjson)). When absent, skip straight to Step 3.

The watcher **stays on the responsive `1m` cadence while blocked** — it never slows or stops the poll. This gate keeps each blocked tick cheap: recompute the fingerprint, re-emit one line to the owner, and only re-run the full Step 3–6 evaluation when the fingerprint moves. Recompute from live state:

- `head_sha` — from the Step 1 refresh.
- `latest_review_id` — `max(id)` over submitted reviews per [`../_shared/vcs/github/submitted-reviews.md`](../_shared/vcs/github/submitted-reviews.md) (`0` if none).
- `ci_digest` — the CI rollup digest for `head_sha` per [`../_shared/vcs/github/pr-checks.md`](../_shared/vcs/github/pr-checks.md): the bucket plus each check's name and conclusion, sorted into one stable string.

Compare to `last_seen.blocked.fingerprint`:

- **Unchanged** → still blocked. **Remind the owner:** emit the one-line reminder per [`output-templates/blocked-reminder.md`](output-templates/blocked-reminder.md) — the pending act plus a reference back to the decision context (the escalation, the review, or the blocked SHA). Increment `last_seen.idle_tick_count`, append a `blocked reason=<reason>` line to `followup.log` per [`output-templates/watcher-log.md`](output-templates/watcher-log.md), emit a `tick` event with `idle: true`, `blocked: true`, `reminded: true`. Exit. The `1m` cron is unchanged — no cron swap, no re-arm.
- **Changed** → the block may have cleared: a new push (`head_sha` moved, which also cleared the per-SHA escalation sets), a new review, or a CI/deploy state change. Clear `last_seen.blocked` and **fall through to Step 3** to re-evaluate against the moved state this same tick. Safe because the cadence was `1m` throughout — there is no slowed cron to swap and no double-arm: if Step 3–6 dispatches, that is the normal single-thread stop-and-respawn; if it idles back into the block, Step 7 re-flags it.

### Step 3 — Compute the actionable set from live thread state

The watcher's dispatch trigger is **derived from current provider state**, not a stored review-id cursor — see the [thread-state baseline design](../../../../muggle-ai-brain/architecture/2026-06-06-pr-followup-thread-state-baseline-design.md). Resolve the provider per [`../_shared/vcs/detect-vcs.md`](../_shared/vcs/detect-vcs.md), then:

- **`github`** — two sources, unioned:

  **(a) Actionable threads.** Fetch unresolved review threads per [`../_shared/vcs/github/unresolved-threads.md`](../_shared/vcs/github/unresolved-threads.md). A thread is **actionable** when `isResolved == false` **and** `isOutdated == false` **and** its newest comment lacks the loop marker `<!-- muggle-do:bot -->` — classify by the marker, never `author.login` (see [`../_shared/pr-followup-helpers/loop-signature.md`](../_shared/pr-followup-helpers/loop-signature.md)). The marker rule makes echo intrinsic: once the loop has replied, the thread's newest comment is the loop's own, so the thread is no longer actionable — no cursor to advance, no self-recursion (see [`../_shared/pr-followup-helpers/echo-skip.md`](../_shared/pr-followup-helpers/echo-skip.md)).

  **(b) Actionable body-only reviews — GitHub only.** A body-only review — a submitted `CHANGES_REQUESTED`/`COMMENTED` review with no line comments — has no thread to derive state from, so it keeps a narrow watermark. GitLab has no review envelope (feedback is always a discussion note), so this sub-branch is GitHub-only and has no GitLab analogue. Fetch submitted reviews per [`../_shared/vcs/github/submitted-reviews.md`](../_shared/vcs/github/submitted-reviews.md); a body-only review is actionable when `id > last_seen.lastBodyReviewId` **and** `id ∉ last_seen.escalated_review_ids`.

  Collect the **owning review ids** for dispatch: for each actionable thread, the owning review of its newest comment (`pullRequestReview.databaseId` from the query); plus every actionable body-only review id. The dedup'd union is the dispatch list.

- **`gitlab`** — single source. Fetch unresolved discussions per [`../_shared/vcs/gitlab/unresolved-discussions.md`](../_shared/vcs/gitlab/unresolved-discussions.md) (drop to [`../_shared/vcs/gitlab/mr-discussions.md`](../_shared/vcs/gitlab/mr-discussions.md) for the raw notes if a thread's classification needs them). A discussion is **actionable** when it is unresolved **and** its newest note lacks the loop marker `<!-- muggle-do:bot -->` — same marker classification, never `author.username`. There is no body-only watermark: discussion state is the sole authority. The dispatch list is the **discussion ids** of the actionable discussions.

### Step 4 — If the actionable set is non-empty → dispatch (reviews preempt CI)

The watcher does **not** classify. Classification, batching, replying, escalation, and cycle execution all live in `/muggle-do`. The watcher hands over the dispatch ids from Step 3 (GitHub: owning review ids; GitLab: discussion ids) and exits — `/muggle-do`'s address-reviews re-derives the unresolved threads itself (its authority), so the watcher only needs to decide *that* there is work, not enumerate it exhaustively.

1. Reset `last_seen.idle_tick_count` to 0.
2. **Stop this watcher (single-thread).** Cancel its cron so no tick fires while the dev cycle runs, per [`cancel-cron.md`](cancel-cron.md). `/muggle-do` respawns the watcher when the cycle finishes — exactly one cron ever, and no tick overlaps a running cycle.
3. Dispatch `/muggle-do` with an *address-reviews* directive carrying:
   - PR URL (from `prs.json[0].url`)
   - Session slug (from the invocation arguments)
   - The dispatch ids from Step 3 (GitHub owning review ids / GitLab discussion ids), as a space-separated list

   Exact phrasing belongs to `/muggle-do`'s intent-routing. A reasonable shape is:
   ```
   /muggle-do address reviews <id1> <id2> ... on <pr-url> slug=<slug>
   ```
4. Append a dispatching line to `followup.log` per [`output-templates/watcher-log.md`](output-templates/watcher-log.md).
5. Emit a `tick` event with `actionable_threads: <count>`, `dispatched_review_ids: [<id>, ...]`.
6. Exit. **Reviews preempt CI** — when there is actionable feedback, this tick dispatches address-reviews and never polls CI. The watcher is now stopped; the dev cycle owns the PR and restarts the watcher when it finishes. (The watcher also self-unschedules in Step 2, terminal.)

### Step 5 — No actionable feedback → keep the branch rebased on its base

A merge-ready branch is **current with its base** — neither conflicting nor behind. From the Step 1 metadata, the branch needs a rebase when either:

- `mergeable == CONFLICTING` (corroborated by `mergeStateStatus == DIRTY`) — conflicts with the base, **or**
- `behind_by > 0` — out of date with the base. Read this from the `compare` call (commit ancestry), **never** from `mergeStateStatus == BEHIND`: GitHub masks `BEHIND` behind `DIRTY`/`BLOCKED` and only surfaces it under "require branches up to date" protection, so a stale PR that is also awaiting review or has a red required check reports `BLOCKED` — and its staleness would go unseen. See [`../_shared/vcs/github/pr-metadata.md`](../_shared/vcs/github/pr-metadata.md#behind-by-out-of-date-detection). On `gitlab`, the same behind-by comes from the compare in [`../_shared/vcs/gitlab/mr-metadata.md`](../_shared/vcs/gitlab/mr-metadata.md#behind-by-out-of-date-detection) (commit ancestry, not `detailed_merge_status`); conflict is `detailed_merge_status` in `{broken_status, conflict}`.

This trigger is **independent of approval and CI state**: an out-of-date branch is rebased whether or not it has been reviewed, approved, or has green checks. The watcher acts on staleness directly — it never waits for an approval to surface it.

If a rebase is due **and** `conflict_resolve_attempts[head_sha] < 2` **and** `head_sha` ∉ `conflict_escalated_shas` → dispatch and exit:

  1. Reset `last_seen.idle_tick_count` to 0.
  2. **Stop this watcher (single-thread):** cancel its cron exactly as in Step 4 — `/muggle-do`'s rebase respawns it when the cycle is done.
  3. Dispatch `/muggle-do` with a *rebase* directive (PR URL + slug; no review ids, no check names):
     ```
     /muggle-do rebase on <pr-url> slug=<slug>
     ```
     The executor rebases onto the base: a behind-only branch replays cleanly and force-pushes; a conflicting branch resolves behind the `autoResolveConflicts` gate. Both paths are `/muggle-do`'s — the watcher only decides *that* a rebase is due, never how.
  4. Append a dispatching line to `followup.log`; emit a `tick` event with `rebase_needed: true`, `dispatched_rebase: true`.
  5. Exit. The dev cycle owns the PR; its respawn restarts the watcher, whose next tick re-checks the branch against its base on the new head — the rebase is its own verify loop, bounded by the per-SHA attempt budget.

Otherwise — `behind_by == 0` and not conflicting (`mergeable == UNKNOWN` is fine here: `behind_by` is exact while GitHub is still computing conflict state, so a stale branch still triggers), or budget spent (`conflict_resolve_attempts[head_sha] >= 2` or `head_sha` ∈ `conflict_escalated_shas`) → fall through to CI.

### Step 6 — No actionable feedback, branch current → poll CI for the head SHA

Fetch the CI rollup for `prs.json[0].head_sha`, provider resolved as in Step 3 — `github` → the check-run rollup per [`../_shared/vcs/github/pr-checks.md`](../_shared/vcs/github/pr-checks.md); `gitlab` → the pipeline-job rollup per [`../_shared/vcs/gitlab/mr-pipeline.md`](../_shared/vcs/gitlab/mr-pipeline.md) (failed/running/success jobs fold into the same red/pending/green buckets). Then, on the bucket:

- **Any check still pending** (`bucket == "pending"`) → idle (wait for checks to settle).
- **All checks green / skipped, or no checks** → idle (green path).
- **One or more checks red** (`bucket == "fail"`), **and** `ci_fix_attempts[head_sha] < 3`, **and** `head_sha` ∉ `ci_escalated_shas` → dispatch and exit:
  1. Reset `last_seen.idle_tick_count` to 0.
  2. **Stop this watcher (single-thread):** cancel its cron exactly as in Step 4 — `/muggle-do`'s fix-ci respawns it when the cycle is done.
  3. Dispatch `/muggle-do` with a *fix-ci* directive carrying the PR URL, slug, and the red check names (no review ids):
     ```
     /muggle-do fix ci <check-1> <check-2> ... on <pr-url> slug=<slug>
     ```
  4. Append a dispatching line to `followup.log`; emit a `tick` event with `checks_red: <count>`, `dispatched_ci_fix: true`.
  5. Exit. The dev cycle owns the PR; its respawn restarts the watcher, whose next tick re-checks CI on the new head SHA — CI itself is the verify loop.
- **One or more red, but `ci_fix_attempts[head_sha] >= 3` or `head_sha` ∈ `ci_escalated_shas`** → idle. The fix budget is spent; `/muggle-do`'s fix-ci stage already recorded the escalation. The watcher does not re-dispatch.

### Step 7 — Idle (remind when blocked pending a human)

Any idle branch (Steps 4–6 that did not dispatch). First classify **why** this tick idled. It is **blocked pending a human** when the head is under a durable block that only the user can clear:

- `head_sha` ∈ `conflict_escalated_shas` — a rebase `/muggle-do` gave up on (a semantic conflict, or `autoResolveConflicts=never`), reason `conflict_escalated`; or
- `head_sha` ∈ `ci_escalated_shas` — CI the fix-ci stage gave up on, reason `ci_escalated`; or
- `last_seen.escalated_review_ids` is non-empty with the actionable set empty — an ambiguous review awaiting the user's direction, reason `reviews_escalated`.

Everything else that idles is **transient** — green and waiting for the next review, CI still pending, or `mergeable == UNKNOWN` — and must keep the responsive `1m` cadence; those turn a state on their own and the watcher should catch it promptly.

**Transient idle** (no durable block): unchanged — increment `last_seen.idle_tick_count`, append an idle line to `followup.log` per [`output-templates/watcher-log.md`](output-templates/watcher-log.md), emit a `tick` event with `idle: true`, `blocked: false`, `reminded: false`, `actionable_threads: 0`, `dispatched_review_ids: []`, `rebase_needed: <bool>`, `dispatched_rebase: false`, `checks_red: <count or 0>`, `dispatched_ci_fix: false`. Exit. The next tick fires in 1 min via `/loop`.

**Blocked pending a human** (a durable block, and `last_seen.blocked` not already set): the watcher **keeps the responsive `1m` cadence** — it must not stop or slow the poll — but turns each blocked tick from a silent idle into a **reminder**. Nothing the watcher does moves a human-blocked PR, so the value of continuing to poll is twofold: keep the owner aware of the pending act until they answer, and catch an external unblock within a minute. The cost stays bounded because each blocked tick is cheap — a fingerprint check and one line out (Step 2.5), not a full re-evaluation. Flag the block and remind:

1. Increment `last_seen.idle_tick_count`.
2. Compute the fingerprint — `{ head_sha, latest_review_id, ci_digest }` exactly as Step 2.5 defines it (reuse the `latest_review_id` / `ci_digest` already fetched this tick). Write `last_seen.blocked = { reason, since: <now>, fingerprint }`.
3. **Remind the owner:** emit the one-line reminder per [`output-templates/blocked-reminder.md`](output-templates/blocked-reminder.md) — the pending act plus a reference back to the decision context.
4. Append a `blocked reason=<reason>` line to `followup.log` per [`output-templates/watcher-log.md`](output-templates/watcher-log.md); emit a `tick` event with `idle: true`, `blocked: true`, `reminded: true`, and the same fields as the transient case. The `1m` cron is unchanged — no cadence swap, no re-arm. Exit.

From the next tick on, the Step 2.5 gate carries the block: it re-reminds the owner each tick and clears the block the instant `head_sha`, a review, or CI moves — so an external unblock (a force-push after the user resolves, a re-review, a staging deploy finishing) is caught within one minute, at no loss of responsiveness.

## Output

The watcher stays invisible to the **GitHub reviewer** — it never posts to the PR from a tick. To the **loop owner** in the session it emits: the turn preamble, the one-line blocked reminder while awaiting the owner (Steps 2.5 / 7), and (when a dispatch fires) the `/muggle-do` directive. Nothing else.
